- **Review Workflow**: Peer review system where users evaluate uploaded content quality
- **AI Quality Control**: Automated content analysis for duplicates and spam detection
- **File Organization**: Secure file storage with categorization and metadata tracking

### Gamification & Rewards
- **XP Point System**: Points earned for uploads, reviews, and quality bonuses
- **Withdrawal System**: Mechanism to convert XP points to monetary rewards
- **Achievement Tracking**: User progress monitoring and engagement metrics

### Administrative Tools
- **Admin Panel**: Comprehensive dashboard for managing users, content, and violations
- **KYC Management**: Identity verification workflow with document and selfie validation
- **Strike Management**: Tools for issuing warnings and managing user violations
- **Content Moderation**: Review queue for flagged or problematic content

## Data Flow

### Upload Process
1. User selects file and provides description/category
2. Frontend validates file type, size, and daily quota
3. AI service analyzes content description for quality/duplicates
4. File is securely stored with metadata in database
5. Upload is queued for peer review
6. User receives XP points for successful upload

### Review Process
1. Reviewers are presented with unreviewed content
2. Reviewers rate content as good/bad with detailed feedback
3. Multiple reviews are aggregated for quality scoring
4. Poor quality content may be flagged or removed
5. Reviewers earn XP points for participation
6. Strike system handles reviewer misconduct

### Admin Workflow
1. Administrators monitor pending KYC verifications
2. Review withdrawal requests and process payments
3. Handle user appeals and strike disputes
4. Oversee platform health metrics and user engagement

## External Dependencies

### Required Services

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Setup
- Local SQLite database for rapid prototyping
- File uploads stored in local uploads/ directory
- Background scheduler for automated tasks
- Debug logging enabled for troubleshooting

### Production Considerations
- Database migration to PostgreSQL for scalability
- Cloud file storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
- Load balancing for high traffic scenarios
- Automated backup systems for user data
- Enhanced security measures and rate limiting

### Scalability Features
- Database connection pooling configured
- Background task scheduling for resource-intensive operations
- Modular architecture allows for microservice migration
- API-ready structure for mobile app integration

The platform is designed to handle growth from small community to large-scale content platform while maintaining data integrity and user experience quality.
